# Carthage Specifications

There are some great frameworks out there, but unfortunately not all of them offer [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) support. Luckily there is an easy workaround to include raw frameworks in your project. It works by hosting a JSON file that provides a mapping between the versions and the matching urls of the framework. After that, all you have to do is to refer to that JSON url in your Cartfile.

This repository was set up in an effort to centralize these JSON files.
